# Topology-changes-prediction-for-proactive-location-based-routing-in-VANETs
Final Year Project

The folder 'Codes' has all the necessary code for this project, and the folder 'Analysis' contains all the analysis data from the code used in the project.

The nodes specified in the file 'Source-destination node pairs' have been predetermined and are utilized in code files that begin with 'src_dest.' These node pairs were determined in previous projects and are not the main focus of the current project. For further information, please refer to the project's report, specifically in the 'reference' section, reference 12.

The dataset for this project has already been processed and can be found in the 'Codes' folder under the names 'I80set1.mat,' 'I80set2.mat,' 'I80set3.mat,' and 'RunNGSIM.mat.' More details regarding this dataset can be found in the project's report, specifically in the 'simulation' section. The original raw dataset can be accessed on the NGSIM website.

To execute the simulations, you can run the Matlab scripts that have names starting with 'test_'. For instance, if you want to simulate the algorithm 'ASMPA' using the dataset 'I80set1', you should run the file named 'test_ASMPA_I80set1'.

You can refer to the report for additional information about this project. The report contains comprehensive details and insights regarding the project, including methodology, results, analysis, and other relevant information.
